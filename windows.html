    <h1>Savonet : Liquidsoap on Windows</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Liquidsoap on Windows.</h3>
<p>
Liquidsoap can be compiled as a native windows binary,
starting with version 1.0, using the mingw32-ocaml cross-compiler.
</p>
<p>
This page described the compilation and limitation of 
this port as well as the difference with the cygwin-based port.
</p>
<h4>Native Liquidsoap vs. Cygwin's Liquidsoap.</h4>
<p>
The aim of the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin project</a> is to 
provide the POSIX API under Windows. It functions as an intermediary
layer which allows to compile and run programs written for the 
POSIX API under Windows.
</p>
<p>
For this purpose, each functionality from POSIX that is not
natively available under Windows, such as fork, posix-specific 
signal management, etc. is <em>emulated</em>, that is, an alternative
implementation is provided by Cygwin.
</p>
<p>
This has the advantage that any program written for a POSIX
system can be compiled and run under Cygwin with virtually 
no changes in the source. However, the drawback is that you
need the whole set of Cygwin's library to do so and emulated
functionalities may not behave completely identically.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, one can compile native binaries under Windows
using for the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/" target="_blank">Mingw</a> port of the 
Gnu C compiler. For instance, the windows port of the OCaml
compiler is compiled using this method.
</p>
<p>
Building native binaries has the advantage that is provides portable
binaries that can be shipped and run without installing Cygwin. However,
this comes with the limitations of the native windows API, in particular
concerning forks of processes and inter-process communications.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the Windows system does not have any convenient shell
system to support the usual <code>configure</code> scripts used in the POSIX
world. The Mingw project provides a native shell for Windows but
it is not sufficient to compile for instance Liquidsoap. Therefore,
the native port of Liquidsoap is <em>cross-compiled</em>: a linux system
is used to produce the native windows binary.
</p>
<p>
In the following, we describe the compilation process and the
inherent limitations of the resulting native binary. Needless to say,
we highly recommend using Liquidsoap under a POSIX system such as 
Linux if you can do so...
</p>
<h4>Limitations of the native port.</h4>
<p>
The main limitation of the native port are the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is not possible to run liquidsoap as a daemon</li>
<li>
All operations involving an external process are not available. This includes:<ul>
<li>
External decoders</li>
<li>
Speech synthesis protocol</li>
<li>
Protocols with file downloads</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Compilation process.</h4>
<p>
<em>Disclaimer</em>: Cross-compiling is not an easy task and there are many tweaks 
and hacks that cannot be documented. This documentation provides guidelines
but it is not complete. If you want to cross-compile your own liquidsoap binary,
you will have to go through multiple trial-and-error processes and find more 
documentation online.
</p>
<p>
The compilation process is describe here for the Debian system. It
may be adapted to any distribution that has an ocaml cross-compiler.
</p>
<p>
First, you need to install the ocaml cross-compiler.
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">apt-get install mingw32-ocaml
</pre>
<p>
This will install the <code>mingw32</code> C compiler as well. 
The file <code>/usr/share/doc/mingw32-ocaml/README.Debian</code> contains
instructions for cross-compiling using this package.
</p>
<p>
Then, you need to install the dependencies for liquidsoap
that are not provided by the Savonet project. This includes
OCaml modules and, when needed, their corresponding C library.
When installing compiled binaries, we take the simplest option and
install everything under <code>/usr/i686-w64-mingw32</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it is currently next to impossible to document
properly how to build a complete cross-compilation environment.
The problem is that not all sources are compatible with cross-compilation
so you may need to edit/change their build system.
</p>
<p>
In the case where the <code>configure</code> script is compatible with cross-compilation, 
it works like this:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">% apt-get source libogg
% cd libogg-&lt;VERSION&gt;
% export \
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig 
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 \
              --host=i686-w64-mingw32
% make
# make install
</pre>
<p>
Once you have setup a complete cross-compilation environment, 
the compilation of Liquidsoap goes as follows:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">% export \
   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig
% export \
   OCAMLFIND_CONF=/etc/i686-w64-mingw32-ocamlfind.conf
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32 \
              --host=i686-w64-mingw32 \
              --disable-camlp4 --disable-debugging \
              --enable-custom-path --disable-graphics
% make
</pre>
<p>
Once you have a proper <code>liquidsoap.exe</code>, you should prepare a directory
containing all the files you need to run it. Its structure is as follows:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">liquidsoap-win32/:
  libs/: all .liq files opened when starting up
  camomile/: camomile files
  liquidsoap.exe
  required DLL files
</pre>
<p>
The <code>libs/</code> directory should contain the libraries provided
by Liquidsoap in <code>pervasives.liq</code> except <code>externals.liq</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once this is ready, you can try your binary, either with wine
or on a native windows system.
